# Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Assignment

Author: @marcusps (GitHub)

This repository cleans up and summarizes the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The file that performs this task is `run_analysis.R`, and no additional files are needed. This file will download and unzip the data, read it into R, and rearrange it as required by the course instructors, and finally save the result into the `tidy-summary.txt` file in the working directory.
